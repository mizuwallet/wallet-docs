# Manifest.json

Every app needs to have its manifest to pass meta information to the wallet. Manifest is a JSON file named as mizuwallet-connect-manifest.json following format:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```mdx
{
	"url": "<app-url>", // required
	"name": "<app-name>", // required
	"iconUrl": "<app-icon-url>", // required
	"termsOfUseUrl": "<terms-of-use-url>", // optional
	"privacyPolicyUrl": "<privacy-policy-url>" // optional
}
```

## Example

You can find an example of the manifest below:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```mdx
{
	"url": "https://mizu.io",
    "name": "mizu Telegram Adapter Test",
  	"iconUrl": "https://placehold.co/400/000000/FFF?text=A",
}
```

## Best Practices

. Best practice is to place the manifest in the root of your app and repository, e.g. https://myapp.com/mizuwallet-connect-manifest.json. It allows the wallet to handle your app better and improve the UX connected to your app.  
. Make sure that manifest.json file is available to GET by its URL.
